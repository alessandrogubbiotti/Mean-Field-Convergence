### MEAN FIELD SYSTEMS
An active macro area in probability and analysis is how to define dynamics in a weak sense, especially when no differentiable structure is available. For instance, in metric measure spaces.

Measures usually evolve following the continuity equation $\partial_t \mu_t = - d^\dagger j_t$. On $X = R^d$, you can think at $j$ as a vector of distributions and $d^\dagger$ as the divergence. However, it is not even clear what $d^\dagger$ is in a metric space. 

To define stochastic dynamics in a weak form, Dirichlet forms have been used ( see in the references MA-Rockner and Fukushima). To define the evolution of the law, the Machinery of Gradient Flows has been developed.
 The two previous techniques work mainly in the reversible setting, while the non-reversible setting is in many cases left aside. Even calling the general setting the  non-reversible setting is not accurate. Referring to the general case negating particular case--and a very special one-- is, quoting  Stanislaw Ulham, like "denoting the bulk zoology as non-elefant zoology". 

The advantages to considering weaker formulations of dynamics is that stability and limiting procedure are easier to prove and hold under more general conditions (on the other hand, uniqueness becomes treackier). For instance, the convergence of the finite dimensional distributions of the law od stochastic processes associated to a Dirichlet form converge if and only if the corresponding Dirichlet forms Mosco converge (see the Paper of Kolestnikov) 

One possible interesting topic is jow to lift the Dirichlet to the space of 1-forms ( It is usually written as $\mu$-depending 1- )

#### Idea of the plan

1) Warm up case: Continuum limit of the Isisng metastable continuum model in 1 dimension( The energy is $H(\sigma) = \sigma_i \sigma_{i+1} + (\sigma^22_{i}-1)^2$).  
1.5) Try to understand the definition of 1-forms in the metric case. Lift the 1-forms.  
2) Zero temperature limit of the Phi42 noiseless model.. Since it is Differnitial equation involving the Laplactiona, I think something of complex analysis enter in some way. The motivation is the Mourrat paper    
or
2) Study mean field of interacring èarticle system. I would like to extend the ftamework of Lo Schiavo to this setting and to use the Gamma convergence to prove stablity    
or
2) Studying the random homology (I don't remember the problem, but this, in case, has to be studied with Artem Gamkin)
2) Infinite temperature limit. It should be possible to do this, but it does not xonvern SPDEs, only SDEs
2) The Schroedinger provlem for Markove processes. (We should contact Lorenzo)
2) Joint small scale time step, zero temperature limit of a one dimrnsoìional system. This should be done with Nadia Ansini
##### Mean field systems 

System of particles usually are used as a model for thermodynamical system to recover the laws of thermodynamics for averaged quantities such as the empirical density and the empirical flow. The easiest interaction that one can place (or better, the second easiest apart from the interction when particles do not interact) is the mean field interaction. This is a hot topic of research in for singular, mean field interaction. 



##### Plan??
 
We could try to start proving the convergence io
